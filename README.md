# Machine Learning Practice with Scikit-Learn

This repository contains my hands-on practice with **Machine Learning** using Python and Scikit-Learn.  
The goal is to strengthen my ML foundations, experiment with models, and build intuition about data preprocessing, training, and evaluation.  

---

## 🚀 What’s Inside  
- 📊 Data preprocessing (cleaning, encoding, scaling)  
- 🤖 Model training & evaluation (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN, etc.)  
- 📈 Performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curves)  
- 🔍 Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV  
- 📦 Modular Jupyter Notebook for practice and experimentation  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python** (3.x)  
- **Scikit-Learn** – ML models & evaluation  
- **Pandas & NumPy** – data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – visualization
